<h1> AIRTIFICIAL INTELLEGENT INTRO </h1>

<img src = "https://www.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/3d-rendering-artificial-intelligence-ai-600w-1722492775.jpg" height = "200px" width = "200px" alt= ai/>

<p> Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information—demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by non-human animals and humans<br>
<p> AI applications include advanced web search engines e.g., Google Search, recommendation systems used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix, understanding human speech such as Siri and Alexa<br>
<p> Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding known as an "AI winter", followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding<br>
<p>  Computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards beneficial goals</p> <hr>

<h2> FEAUTURES <h2>

<p> Eliminate dull and boring tasks<br>
<p> Data ingestion<br>
<p>Imitates human cognition<br>
<p>Futuristic<br>
<p>Prevent natural disasters<br>
<p>Facial Recognition and Chatbots</p> <hr>

<h2> DISADVANTAGES </h2>

<p> The ability to create a machine that can simulate human intelligence is no small feat. It requires plenty of time and resources and can cost a huge deal of money<br>
<p> A big disadvantage of AI is that it cannot learn to think outside the box. AI is capable of learning over time with pre-fed data and past experiences, but cannot be creative in its approach<br>

<h2> AI IN LEADIND COMPANIES </h2>

<p>Chinese company Alibaba is the world’s largest e-commerce platform that sells more than Amazon and eBay combined<br>
<p>Alphabet is Google’s parent company. Waymo, the company’s self-driving technology division, began as a project at Google. Today, Waymo wants to bring self-driving technology to the world to not only to move people around, but to reduce the number of crashes<br>
<p>Not only is Amazon in the artificial intelligence game with its digital voice assistant, Alexa, but artificial intelligence is also part of many aspects of its business. Another innovative way Amazon uses artificial intelligence is to ship things to you before you even think about buying it<br>
<p>One of the primary ways Facebook uses artificial intelligence and deep learning is to add structure to its unstructured data.</p> <hr>

<h2> AI IN INDIAN ECONOMY </h2>

<p>AI Platforms Next Frontier for Indian IT Services, Implications of AI on the Indian Economy, Indian retail<br>
<p>AI could add $450-500bn to India’s GDP by 2025. Close to 45% of this value is likely to be delivered by 3 sectors: consumer goods and retail, agriculture and banking and finance<br>
<p>Increased efficiency in supporting functions Ex: Nebulaa with the help of AI and data from various agricultural markets in India for quick, accurate and cheap quality testing Ex: Aspiring Minds<br>
<p>Regulating critical natural resources such as groundwater and renewable energy. Ex: Artelus uses AI-backed screening tool that uses deep learning to check for Diabetic Retinopathy, early onset of TB </p><hr>
 
<h2> AI IS GOOD ARE BAD </h2>

<p>It is nothing good or bad to artificial intelligence(AI) it will simply respond with results that are derived completely by its learning<br>
<P>The good or badness of AI will depend on how well we train the AI, and perhaps most importantly how well we test the artificial intelligence
