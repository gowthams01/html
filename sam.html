<h1> mango </h1>
<P> A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica.<br> It is believed to have originated between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India.[1] M.<br> indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two types of modern mango cultivars: the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian type".[2][3] Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits that are also called "mangoes", the majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion.[
